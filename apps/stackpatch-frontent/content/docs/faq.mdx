## FAQ

Common questions and answers about StackPatch.

## General

### What is StackPatch?

StackPatch is a CLI tool that helps you add production-ready features to your Next.js projects. Think of it as shadcn/ui, but for complete features instead of components.

### How is StackPatch different from other tools?

- **No vendor lock-in** - You own every line of code
- **Incremental adoption** - Add features to existing projects
- **Fully reversible** - Track and revert any installation
- **Smart detection** - Automatically adapts to your project structure

### Is StackPatch free?

Yes! StackPatch is completely free and open source.

## Installation

### What do I need to use StackPatch?

- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- A Next.js project with App Router
- TypeScript (recommended)

### Can I use StackPatch with an existing project?

Yes! StackPatch is designed to work with existing Next.js projects. Just navigate to your project and run `npx stackpatch add auth`.

### Can I create a new project with StackPatch?

Yes! Use `npx stackpatch create my-app` to create a new Next.js project, then add patches as needed.

## Usage

### How do I add authentication?

```bash
npx stackpatch add auth
```

Then select which OAuth providers you want (Google, GitHub, Email/Password).

### Can I customize the generated code?

Absolutely! All code is yours to modify. StackPatch generates production-ready code that you can customize however you want.

### What if I want to remove a patch?

Use `npx stackpatch revert` to safely remove all files and restore your project to its previous state.

## OAuth Setup

### Do I need to set up OAuth providers immediately?

No. StackPatch will create the configuration files. You can set up OAuth credentials later when you're ready to deploy.

### Can I add more OAuth providers later?

Yes! You can manually add more providers to the NextAuth configuration file after installation.

### Is email/password authentication production-ready?

The email/password authentication is in demo mode by default. You'll need to implement database integration for production use.

## Technical

### How does StackPatch detect my project structure?

StackPatch checks for the existence of `app/` or `src/app/` directories and places files accordingly.

### Does StackPatch modify my existing files?

StackPatch only modifies `layout.tsx` to add providers. All changes are tracked and can be reverted. Original content is backed up in `.stackpatch/backups/`.

### What if I have a custom project structure?

StackPatch works best with standard Next.js App Router structures. If you have a custom setup, you may need to adjust file paths manually.

### Can I use StackPatch with TypeScript path aliases?

Yes! StackPatch automatically reads your `tsconfig.json` and uses your path aliases for imports.

## Troubleshooting

### The revert command isn't working

Make sure you're in the directory where you ran `stackpatch add`. The command uses `.stackpatch/manifest.json` to track changes.

### Files aren't in the right location

StackPatch detects your structure automatically. If files are in the wrong place, check that your project follows standard Next.js App Router conventions.

### Import errors after installation

- Check your `tsconfig.json` paths configuration
- Make sure StackPatch detected your path aliases correctly
- Verify that the generated import paths match your alias patterns

### OAuth buttons not working

- Verify credentials in `.env.local`
- Restart your dev server after adding credentials
- Make sure you selected the provider during installation
- Check browser console for errors
